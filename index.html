<br>    
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<P>   With the beginning of the millennium, the world started to turn
     faster with a face paced work environment and technological development. People started to need more time to be able to
      meet working requirements. This business brings a need for good time management. According to most managers in big companies
      , time management is the most important part of the work because it helps you reduce stress and prioritize your time. Therefore, 
      the need for a business focused time planning management application for meeting reservations increases day by day.</P>
            
    <br><br>
    <h2>II. Project Description</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>A. Overview</h4>
    <p>   The meeting reservation applications used in the past cannot satisfy the new business requirements. The aim of this project is to develop a software that can extend the facilities of meeting reservation applications beyond the current bare situation. We believe that this project will meet strategic, operational, and administrative requirements of business. Also finding out a new solution to the problems of finding an appointment at a suitable time in the comfort of our home by using mobile solutions which are popular and convenient nowadays for users. 
        When we look at the project from a bird's eye view, users can discover the nearby suppliers providers,their available times,price ranges and the services they offer.They can make reservations by pre-paiding some amount on e-payment system. Also users can able to comment and evaluate their past deals.We are planning to develop this project for hairdresser, football pitch industry and individuals which will beneficial both service seller and buyer.

<br>
<h2>III. Preliminary Plan</h2>
<br>
<h4>A. Planned Deliverables</h4>
<h6>Phase 1</h6>
<p>   At phase 1, we will define the requirements of our customer. If a new requirement emerges, we will specify the new requirements. Also, the non-functional and functional requirements that occur from the customers’ requirements will be discovered and added by the team.</p>
<p>   At the end of Phase 1, we will have a clear idea of functional and non-functional requirements of the customer.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 2</h6>
<p>   At this part, the design of our system generally. We will design a back end that we need to recover the upcoming infrastructural needs, specific interfaces design, components design that we will use and system architecture of the system.</p>
<p>   At the end of phase 2, we will have the needed specific designs and architecture to start the development of the project.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 3</h6>
<p>   After design and requirement specification, we will start to implement specific tools, algorithms, and interfaces. Then we will test them separately like unit testing.</p>
<p>   At the end of Phase 3, we will have the specific parts of the project that can be developed separately.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 4</h6>
<p>   After implementing the specific parts, the development of all specific parts will be done. We will integrate all the parts. Then we will start to test all systems. And review the system by analysis of test outputs.</p>
<p>   At the end of Phase 4, we will have the first completed version.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 5</h6>
<p>   Deployment of the dedicated areas such as Play Store & Web will be done; the tests and validation part will be done.</p>
<p>   Then the system management, admin panel and maintenance plan will be done according to the use cases that will be done both with customer, admin, and super admins.</p>
<p>   We will have the needed feedback about the project from the customer. Also, the post-deployment (management and admin panel usage) part will be handled in order to satisfy and meet the customer requirements.
</p>
<h4>B. Working Plan</h4>
<p>1- General Analysis</p>
<p>2- Requirement Analysis</p>
<p>3- Design</p>
<p>4- Initial design report</p>
<p>5- SRS document</p>
<p>6- A small prototype</p>
<br>
<p>   There are many real-life scenarios about videos, papers, and internet archives. These resources will help us to identify the requirements for commercial-personal meetings and reservational operations. Furthermore, these sources will lead us to a good design and a good project. We are going to need real hairdressers and football enthusiasts for an interview because in the end, the They are going to be users of this project and learning the needs of them will push our team to create a better design. We are planning to use CI/CD tools for our development process such as Trello to control the workflow in our project.</p>
<p>   Thanks to technology we have many opportunities to collaborate as a team. We are planning to meet both face to face and online. We are planning to work together as a team because having different ideas for a part of the project will lead to new ideas for everybody. Also, working together is increasing our team working ability and it will help us to collaborate with different teams for the future projects and jobs. We are going to have both zoom and face to face meetings in the project timeline to make everything ready for homework and for the project.</p>
<p>   The biggest milestone of this project is the SRS document, because it is going to be our base to develop this project. Since other steps are going to follow the SRS document, the document should be well prepared in every aspect.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 33%;"><h2> PROJECT PROPOSAL</h2></div>
<br>
<br>    
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<P>   With the beginning of the millennium, the world started to turn
     faster with a face paced work environment and technological development. People started to need more time to be able to
      meet working requirements. This business brings a need for good time management. According to most managers in big companies
      , time management is the most important part of the work because it helps you reduce stress and prioritize your time. Therefore, 
      the need for a business focused time planning management application for meeting reservations increases day by day.</P>
            
    <br><br>
    <h2>II. Project Description</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>A. Overview</h4>
    <p>   The meeting reservation applications used in the past cannot satisfy the new business requirements.

<br>
<h2>III. Preliminary Plan</h2>
<br>
<h4>A. Planned Deliverables</h4>
<h6>Phase 1</h6>
<p>   At phase 1, we will define the requirements of our customer. If a new requirement emerges, we will specify the new requirements. Also, the non-functional and functional requirements that occur from the customers’ requirements will be discovered and added by the team.</p>
<p>   At the end of Phase 1, we will have a clear idea of functional and non-functional requirements of the customer.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 2</h6>
<p>   At this part, the design of our system generally. We will design a back end that we need to recover the upcoming infrastructural needs, specific interfaces design, components design that we will use and system architecture of the system.</p>
<p>   At the end of phase 2, we will have the needed specific designs and architecture to start the development of the project.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 3</h6>
<p>   After design and requirement specification, we will start to implement specific tools, algorithms, and interfaces. Then we will test them separately like unit testing.</p>
<p>   At the end of Phase 3, we will have the specific parts of the project that can be developed separately.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 4</h6>
<p>   After implementing the specific parts, the development of all specific parts will be done. We will integrate all the parts. Then we will start to test all systems. And review the system by analysis of test outputs.</p>
<p>   At the end of Phase 4, we will have the first completed version.</p>
<br>
<h6>Phase 5</h6>
<p>   Deployment of the dedicated areas such as Play Store & Web will be done; the tests and validation part will be done.</p>
<p>   Then the system management, admin panel and maintenance plan will be done according to the use cases that will be done both with customer, admin, and super admins.</p>
<p>   We will have the needed feedback about the project from the customer. Also, the post-deployment (management and admin panel usage) part will be handled in order to satisfy and meet the customer requirements.
</p>
<h4>B. Working Plan</h4>
<p>1- General Analysis</p>
<p>2- Requirement Analysis</p>
<p>3- Design</p>
<p>4- Initial design report</p>
<p>5- SRS document</p>
<p>6- A small prototype</p>
<br>
<p>   There are many real-life scenarios about videos, papers, and internet archives. These resources will help us to identify the requirements for commercial-personal meetings and reservational operations. Furthermore, these sources will lead us to a good design and a good project. We are going to need real hairdressers and football enthusiasts for an interview because in the end, the They are going to be users of this project and learning the needs of them will push our team to create a better design. We are planning to use CI/CD tools for our development process such as Trello to control the workflow in our project.</p>
<p>   Thanks to technology we have many opportunities to collaborate as a team. We are planning to meet both face to face and online. We are planning to work together as a team because having different ideas for a part of the project will lead to new ideas for everybody. Also, working together is increasing our team working ability and it will help us to collaborate with different teams for the future projects and jobs. We are going to have both zoom and face to face meetings in the project timeline to make everything ready for homework and for the project.</p>
<p>   The biggest milestone of this project is the SRS document, because it is going to be our base to develop this project. Since other steps are going to follow the SRS document, the document should be well prepared in every aspect.</p>

            <h2>1.Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                The old meeting reservation software cannot meet the demands of the modern business. The purpose of this project is to create a contemporary product that enhances the meeting reservation ways.
                While finding out a new solution to the problems of finding an appointment at a suitable time in the comfort of our home, protection of private user information from malicious users is also vital for professionality and ethicality of the software.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

 <h3>1.1 Description </h3>
<h4>1.1.1 Outline of the Project: </h4>
<p>
Project mainly stands on making the reservations process seamless and painless to users. Users could discover the nearby providers, their available times, price ranges and the services they offer. Users can make reservations by pre-paying some amount using e-payment systems. Also, users can comment and evaluate their past deals. We are planning to develop this project for hairdressers, the football pitch industry and individuals which will be beneficial both service sellers and buyers.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>
    1.2 Constraints 
</h3>
<p>- Project constraints for the economic section is development of a safe payment system by using a 3D secure payment, encapsulation of credit card data, which is related to ethical constraints. </p>
<p>
    - Socially and ethically, all personal information of users will be kept secret and will not be published. Reservation details of users and business partners will not be shared with third party organizations to maintain our application's safety constraints. 
</p>
<p>
- Location information of users will only be used for necessary operations inside of our application. 

</p>
<p>
    - With the effect of the pandemic most of the hairdressers work with a reservation. They did that with a notebook and phone calls. They store the reservation hours and customer info in a notebook. This situation leads to conflicts and time loss. Also, customers must call hairdressers in every unexpected situation. 

</p>

<p>
    - Reserve It supports the sector in terms of trade of ethics by monitoring all available sellers around the consumers, our software establishes a competitive environment and prevents exorbitant pricing. In addition, it is important for transparency and price consistency that pricing scales and payment channels are carried out from a stand-alone application.
</p>

<p> 
    - Every time they want to play football on pitch, they need to research nearby pitches first, then they look for availability of these pitches if they are not available and don't fit with the customer’s schedule, this cycle must return to the beginning and people look for new pitches. Also, all these stages are made by phone call without any visual process. Every time in this cycle people need to contact another person to make arrangements. Our system is going to exist to prevent this time loss and dealing with the human relationship as a social constraint.
</p>

<p>

    -  One of the main purposes of the app is serving pitches.

    2. Requirements
</h2>
<p>
    - Since the project offers location-based solutions, location information of the users should be collected, and necessary permissions should be taken into consideration. 
</p>
<p>
    - In our software, since suppliers will register the application with their business account, they must specify their tax numbers in order to prevent legal issues and safely identify their businesses. 
</p>
<p>
    - The application has e-payment methods for some operations. Therefore, it needs to reach credit card information to do banking operations.
</p>

<p>

    - Since our application will be used from individuals other than the suppliers, we should have attained their personal information such as phone number, e-mail etc. as well.
